# CS50W-Project 2

Chat application web app project for CS50W course which is offered by Harvard at edX. My personal touch is not a feature but an algorithm which calculates the local time of every client on their browser according to the server-side time of the message. So every user sees the message time on their timezone. You can check the algorithm in the script file as a function named "calculateClientTimeOfMessage".

**This project doesn't use any database. Datas are stored in application memory.**
